# Simple Blink
The Simple Blink code allows the on board LED to toggle on an off with a 50% duty cycle.

## Boards Used
* MSP430G2553
* MSP430FR2311

## How the Code Works (G2553)
The code works by setting Pin 1.0 as an output. The code then goes into a loop where it uses an XOR operation to toggle the LED.

### Pin Outs
Pin 1.0 - LED output 

## How the Code Works (FR2311)
The code works by setting Pin 1.0 as an output. The code then goes into a loop where it uses an XOR operation to toggle the LED.

### Pin Outs
Pin 1.0 - LED Output
