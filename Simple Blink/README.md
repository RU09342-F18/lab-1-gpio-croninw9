# Simple Blink
For starters, you will need to blink one of the on-board LED's at a particular rate. It is up to you to determine what rate you want to blink it at, however it has to be symmetrical (50% Duty Cycle), meaning equal times on and off. You should attempt multiple different speeds before moving on to the next part of the lab.

Remember to replace this README with your README once you are ready to submit. I would recommend either making a copy of this file or taking a screen shot. There might be a copy of all of these README's in a folder on the top level depending on the exercise.
